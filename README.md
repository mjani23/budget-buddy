**Project Overview**  
Budget Buddy is a personal finance application developed using .NET MAUI. It allows users to manage their income, track expenses, set savings goals, and build monthly budgets. The application estimates take home pay based on income, filing status, and state.

All data is stored locally using SQLite across sessions. The app is designed to work on multiple platforms including iOS, Android, and Mac using MAUI’s cross platform capabilities.

Each section of the app was developed and tested independently before integration.
